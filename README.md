# HACK_THE_DATA_PaperBoat
This is an Machine Learning project with the primary goal to find the insights from the given term deposit data of 45211 customers and then build a model to predict which future customers are more likely to get converted on the basis of previous data.
As the Data was heavily baised and to prevent over fitting, we chose Random forrest as our Predicting Model.
